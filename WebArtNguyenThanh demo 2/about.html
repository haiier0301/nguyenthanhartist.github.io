                    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nguyen Thanh (born in Quang Binh, Vietnam) is a contemporary abstract painter whose artistic formation bridges rural serenity and urban dynamism. After graduating from the College of Pedagogy, Fine Arts Department in 1999, he began his professional practice in 2002. Over more than two decades, he has developed a distinctive visual language centered on atmosphere, luminosity, and emotional resonance. His works have been exhibited in Vietnam, London, Montreal, Miami, and France, and appear in private collections across Asia, Europe, and North America.

                    <h2>ARTISTIC PRACTICE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Working primarily with oil on canvas, Thanh constructs layered surfaces through a dialogue of palette knife and brushwork. His compositions evoke horizon lines, shifting weather, and meditative urban silhouettes without literal description. Each painting operates as an environment of perception—where movement and stillness, intensity and quietude, coexist. Light plays a structural role in his work, emerging through translucent color fields and rhythmic spatial transitions.

                    <h2>ARTISTIC PHILOSOPHY</h2>
                    <p>
                        Guided by the ideals of Truth – Goodness – Beauty, Thanh approaches abstraction as a contemplative practice. His paintings offer spaces of reflection within the pace of contemporary life, encouraging viewers to slow down and encounter a sense of balance and inner calm. Through emotional color harmonies and atmospheric depth, he seeks to create works that resonate beyond form and narrative, inviting personal connection and quiet introspection.
